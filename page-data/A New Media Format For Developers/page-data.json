It combines code editor operations and audio<sup>1</sup>.</p>\n<p>You can record a Codio by running the “Record Codio” command inside your IDE, programming like you normally would and then running “Save Codio”. This will create a Codio file that includes the operations you have done on that IDE, like inserting text and moving between files, and your audio recording.</p>\n<p>You can then play that Codio inside another IDE. That would replay the actions you have done inside your IDE in sync with the audio recording</p>\n<p>One important difference between Codio and other media formats such as video is that the frame of a Codio recording is an IDE with some state, which means that at any point the viewer can start to interact with it. That makes Codio an inherently interactive media format.</p>\n<p>The current implementation has extensions for vscode and intellij. They include both a Codio recorder and a Codio player and are in alpha stage. You can go to <a href=\"https://github.com/wix-incubator/codio\">the repo</a> or get the VSCode extension from the <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.codio\">marketplace</a>.</p>\n<p>A deep dive into the format and the motivation will be published soon<sup>™</sup>.</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<p><sup>1</sup> Codio = operations on code + audio</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A New Media Format For Developers","date":1582651087658,"description":" ","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.471264367816092,"src":"/static/a514f5f1db326358f9ef49749d5c03f1/e9aae/codio.png","srcSet":"/static/a514f5f1db326358f9ef49749d5c03f1/e9aae/codio.png 128w","sizes":"(max-width: 128px) 100vw, 128px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/A New Media Format For Developers/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Choosing a Music Teacher/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Choosing a Music Teacher"}},"next":null}}}
