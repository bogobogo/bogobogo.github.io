It combines code editor operations and audio<sup>1</sup>.</p>\n<p>You can record a Codio by running the “Record Codio” command inside your IDE, programming like you normally would and then running “Save Codio”. This will create a Codio file that includes the operations you have done on that IDE, like inserting text and moving between files, and your audio recording.</p>\n<p>You can then play that Codio inside another IDE. That would replay the actions you have done inside your IDE in sync with the audio recording</p>\n<p>One important difference between Codio and other media formats such as video is that the frame of a Codio recording is an IDE with some state, which means that at any point the viewer can start to interact with it. That makes Codio an inherently interactive media format.</p>\n<p>The current implementation has extensions for vscode and intellij. They include both a Codio recorder and a Codio player and are in alpha stage. You can go to <a href=\"https://github.com/wix-incubator/codio\">the repo</a> or get the VSCode extension from the <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.codio\">marketplace</a>.</p>\n<p>A deep dive into the format and the motivation will be published soon<sup>™</sup>.</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<p><sup>1</sup> Codio = operations on code + audio</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A New Media Format For Developers","date":1582651087658,"description":" ","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":0.9871794871794872,"src":"/static/4e290b5d8e502edda10dfe1f29e7b6d8/2f7ae/codio.png","srcSet":"/static/4e290b5d8e502edda10dfe1f29e7b6d8/d3809/codio.png 150w,\n/static/4e290b5d8e502edda10dfe1f29e7b6d8/fdbb0/codio.png 300w,\n/static/4e290b5d8e502edda10dfe1f29e7b6d8/2f7ae/codio.png 539w","sizes":"(max-width: 539px) 100vw, 539px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/A New Media Format For Developers/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Choosing a Music Teacher/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Choosing a Music Teacher"}},"next":null}}}
