It combines operations on a code editor and audio<sup>1</sup>.</p>\n<p>You can record a Codio by running the “Record Codio” command inside your IDE, programming like you normally would and then running “Save Codio”. This will create a codio file that includes the operations you have done on that IDE, such as inserting text and moving between files, and your audio recording.</p>\n<p>You can then play that Codio inside another IDE. That would replay the actions you have done inside your IDE in sync with the audio recording</p>\n<p>One important difference between Codio and other media formats such as video is that the frame of a Codio recording is an IDE with some state, which means that at any point the viewer can start to interact with it. That makes Codio an inherently interactive media format.</p>\n<p>The current implementation has extensions for vscode and intellij. They include both a Codio recorder and a Codio player and are in alpha stage. You can find them <a href=\"https://github.com/wix-incubator/codio\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>A deep dive into the format and the motivation will be published soon<sup>™</sup>.</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<p><sup>1</sup> Codio = operations on code + audio</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A New Media Format For Developers","date":1582651087658,"description":" "}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/A New Media Format For Developers/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Choosing a Music Teacher/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Choosing a Music Teacher"}},"next":null}}}
